# Todo-List

A simple and intuitive to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the use of `localStorage` to persist tasks across browser sessions. Users can add, view, and delete tasks, with all changes automatically saved in the browser's local storage to ensure that your to-do list remains intact even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task description and due date and click "Add" to include it in your list.
- **View Tasks**: See all your tasks displayed with their respective due dates.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list as needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` so that they persist across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for managing tasks and utilizing `localStorage`.

3. **Delete a Task**:
