# Todo-List

A simple and intuitive to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the use of `localStorage` to persist tasks across browser sessions. Users can add, view, and delete tasks, with all changes automatically saved in the browser's local storage to ensure that your to-do list remains intact even after refreshing the page.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the application here: [Live Demo](https://haidarraza21.github.io/Todo-List/)

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task description and due date and click "Add" to include it in your list.
- **View Tasks**: See all your tasks displayed with their respective due dates.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list as needed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` so that they persist across page reloads.
